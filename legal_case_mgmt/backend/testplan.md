# Document Upload Functionality Test Plan

## Objective
Test the document upload functionality of the legal case management system by creating and uploading 50 different legal litigation-related files, including some large text files to test AI RAG vector indexing and search capabilities.

## Steps

1. **Create 50 Legal Litigation-Related Files**
   - Generate a variety of legal documents including:
     - Case briefs
     - Legal contracts
     - Court filings
     - Evidence documents
     - Legal correspondence
     - Research papers
     - Legal opinions
     - Deposition transcripts
     - Settlement agreements
     - Legal memos

2. **Include Large Text Files**
   - Create several large text files to test AI RAG vector indexing:
     - Detailed case briefs (10,000+ words)
     - Extensive legal contracts (15,000+ words)
     - Comprehensive research papers (20,000+ words)
     - Long deposition transcripts (25,000+ words)

3. **Store Files in Documents Directory**
   - Save all generated files in the 'documents/' directory for easy access during the upload process.

4. **Upload Files to Cases**
   - Use the document upload functionality to upload all 50 files to specific cases in the system.

5. **Verify Upload and Indexing**
   - Ensure all files are successfully uploaded and indexed by the AI RAG system.

6. **Test Search Functionality**
   - Perform searches on the uploaded documents to verify the AI RAG search capabilities, especially on the large text files.

## Next Steps
- Implement the document generation script to create the 50 files.
- Execute the upload and search tests as outlined above.
